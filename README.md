# Practical Assignment - Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains the practical assignment carried out for the Universidad Argentina de la Empresa (UADE). In this project, various fundamental data structures and algorithms have been implemented and analyzed. Below are the topics covered:

## Contents

1. **Graph Algorithms**:
   - Implementation of graphs using adjacency lists and adjacency matrices.
   - Graph traversal algorithms: BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search).
   - Shortest path algorithms: Dijkstra and Floyd-Warshall.
   - Cycle detection and strongly connected components.

2. **Trees**:
   - Implementation of binary trees and binary search trees (BST).
   - Tree traversals: inorder, preorder, and postorder.
   - Operations for insertion, deletion, and search in trees.
   - Balanced trees: AVL and Red-Black Trees.

3. **Stacks**:
   - Implementation of stacks using linked lists and arrays.
   - Basic operations: push, pop, and peek.
   - Applications of stacks in problems such as arithmetic expression evaluation and parenthesis balancing.

4. **Queues**:
   - Implementation of queues using linked lists and arrays.
   - Circular queues and double-ended queues (deque).
   - Applications of queues in breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms and task management systems.

5. **Dictionaries (Maps)**:
   - Implementation of dictionaries using hash tables.
   - Collision handling: chaining and open addressing.
   - Applications of dictionaries in efficient data search and storage problems.

6. **Sets**:
   - Implementation of sets using list structures and hash tables.
   - Basic operations: union, intersection, difference, and membership testing.
   - Applications of sets in set theory problems and graph algorithms.
